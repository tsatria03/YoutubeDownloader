Welcome to YouTube downloader! YouTube Downloader is a simple and accessible application written in Python using the wxPython library.
It is designed specifically for screen reader users, offering a user-friendly interface and support for downloading both audio and video from YouTube. The app provides real-time progress feedback through beeps and optional status messages.

Features
The interface is easy to navigate and fully operable with a keyboard, making it accessible to screen reader users. Users can enable progress beeps that indicate the current download progress.
They can also customize the beep interval to occur every 1%, 5%, or 10%. Downloads can be saved to a custom folder of your choice.
The app supports several video formats including MP4, AVI, and MKV. It also supports audio formats such as MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, and M4A.
There is an option to download entire playlists or channels when available. Additionally, you can choose whether the download status is shown in the bottom status bar or displayed as a label on the main screen.

How to use.
To use the app, first launch it and paste a YouTube video or playlist URL into the input field. Then, select your desired format from the dropdown menu. If you'd like to download an entire playlist or channel, you can check the box labeled Download full playlist/channel if available.
Next, choose a folder where you'd like the file to be saved, or simply leave the field empty to use the default ./dl folder. Once you're ready, click the Download button and wait for the process to complete.
If progress beeps are enabled, you'll hear audio feedback during the download. You can monitor the current status either in the bottom status bar or through the on-screen label, depending on your settings.

Enjoy, and happy downloading!
